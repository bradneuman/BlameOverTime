SQL table structure:

blames:
repo, commit, file_ref, commit_author_ref, author_ref, lines (+ or -), time

authors:
author_name, email, author_ref

filenames:
filename, file_ref

file_refs
file_ref, ignored

commits: (maybe don't do this one at all, its' easy to look up with git)
repo, commit, date, timezone, revlist_order


SQL would look something like:

SELECT blames.date, blames.author, SUM(blames.lines) FROM blames
  INNER JOIN file_refs ON blames.file_ref == file_refs.file_ref
  WHERE blames.author="brad" 
    AND NOT file_refs.ignored
  GROUP_BY blames.author
  ORDER_BY blames.date



ideally we'd not run the damn blame on each revision, but the problem is that git doesn't know which blame
lines got removed without looking them up, and there doesn't seem to be a super easy way to do that, without
running blame. I could try to implement it, but I'm sure I'd get caught up in old lines, new lines,
etc. Rather just run 50x slower and let it be correct....



for each commit, starting from the beginning:

add an entry to the commits table. If there was already one there, skip this commit

for each file in ls-tree:

run git blame -w -C -M --porcelain, and parse it like the code in GitPython does. Since we started from the
beginning, we know that only the latest commit is of interest, so just skip anything that's not that (since we
already have entries for those! Maybe write some code that tests this, and then disable it later. Should be
able to see those commits in the commits table). for the ones that are the current commit, create a blames
entry.

actually, while discarding lines, pay attention to filenames. If there are any that don't match the current
filename, keep track of this because this signifies a file rename / move. Find the file_ref from the older
filename, and use that as the current file_ref, but also add an entry to the filenames table with the new
name. If there are no other filenames, then just check the filenames table and if it exists, use that file_ref
in the blames row. Otherwise, insert a new entry into file_refs (file_ref field should self-increment), and
add another new one to filenames with the recently-added file_ref

As an optimiazation, we only need to run this on files touched in the given commit



You can use `git diff rev rev^` to see the diff for the given rev. usefaul args for git diff:
-U0 show 0 extra lines around diff
--name-only onlhy output names of changed files
--no-color
-C -M detect copies and moves

run `git diff -C -M -U0 --no-color  rev rev^`, then parse the output:

lines starting with "---" and "+++" should be next to eachother and are filenames. Figure out how to use this
to detect renames?

Lines starting with "@@" show the line numbers for the preceding file.  e.g.: @@ -252,3 +240,3 @@ means that
in the old file, 3 lines starting at 252 were modified, and in the new one, 3 lines starting at 240 were
modified



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ok, whole new plan. Use the diff stuff above. Parse the lines. Run blame with -L on the old rev to see who
lost lines. Then just count the lines and whoever did the commit gained those lines. Make that as two seperate
entries. That way a single user who changed code can get points for being finicky


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unrealted note: look into textconv when I get back. It looks like it allows you to specify a program to make
binary diffs nicer. I'm thinking it could be used with xcdump?

latest issue: merge commits

How I'm handling them now is wrong. I'm ignoring them, but then when I look at the commit after a merge, and
try to figure out how many lines were lost, I'll look at the merge commit, and I might count lines lost from
the merge author, when the merge author never got credit for those lines in the first place

Instead, I need to detect if the parent is a merge. If so, I need to look at the *commit* from blame
line-porcelain. And if it is that merge commit, then I need to check both parents, and take whichever one was
committed last (since that will have usurped the previous one already). Other idea: since I'm doing these in
rev-list order, maybe I can just always grab the last commit I did, instead of using the ^ operator in git
